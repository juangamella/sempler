Sempler: Sampling from general structural causal models (SCMs)
==============================================================

Disclaimer: This package is still at its infancy and the API could be
subject to change. Use at your own risk, but also know that feedback is
very welcome :)

Two main classes are provided:

-  ``sempler.ANM``: to define and sample from general additive noise
   SCMs. Any assignment function is possible, as are the noise
   distributions.
-  ``sempler.LGANM``: to define and sample from a linear model with
   Gaussian additive noise (i.e. a Gaussian Bayesian network).

Both classes define a ``sample`` function which generates samples from
the SCM, in the observational setting or under interventions.

Additionally, ``sempler.LGANM`` allows sampling "in the population
setting", i.e. by returning a symbolic gaussian distribution,
``sempler.NormalDistribution``, defined by its mean and covariance,
which allows for manipulation such as conditioning, marginalization and
regression in the population setting.

ANMs - General Additive Noise Models
------------------------------------

The ANM class allows to define and sample from general additive noise
models. Any assignment function is possible, as are the noise
distributions.

ANMs are defined by providing the following arguments:

1. ``A`` (``np.array``): a connectivity matrix, representing the
   underlying DAG, , where ``A[i,j]=1`` denotes a directed edge from i to j.

2. ``assignments`` (``list``): the functional assignments, i.e. a list
   with a function per variable in the SCM, which takes as many
   arguments as parents (incoming edges) of the variable and returns a
   single (numerical) value. For variables which are source nodes in the
   graph, ``None`` is used.

3. ``noise_distributions`` (``list``): the noise distributions of each
   variable, i.e. a list with a function per variable which can be
   called with a single (int) parameter n and returns n samples. Any
   distribution is possible (even arbitrary deterministic ones); see
   sempler.noise for common ones (uniform, gaussian, laplace, ...).

The parameters of the ANM follow this *functional* approach to give you
maximum flexibility. For more standard, linear SCMs with gaussian noise,
it is easier to use the LGANM class.

Sampling
~~~~~~~~

Samples are generated by calling the ``sample`` function, with
parameters:

-  ``n`` (``int``): the number of samples
-  ``do\_interventions`` (``dict``, optional): a dictionary containing
   the distribution functions (see ``sempler.noise``) from which to
   generate samples for each intervened variable
-  ``shift\_interventions`` (``dict``, optional): a dictionary
   containing the distribution functions (see ``sempler.noise``) from
   which to generate the noise which is added to each intervened
   variable
-  ``random\_state`` (``int``, optional): seed for the random state
   generator

An example: creating an ANM with standard Gaussian noise and linear and
non-linear assignments, and sampling from it.

.. code:: python

    import sempler
    import sempler.noise as noise
    import numpy as np

    # Connectivity matrix
    A = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
      [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

    # Noise distributions (see sempler.noise)
    noise_distributions = [noise.normal(0,1)] * 5

    # Variable assignments
    functions = [None, None, np.sin, lambda x: np.exp(x[:,0]) + 2*x[:,1], lambda x: 2*x]

    # All together
    anm = sempler.ANM(A, functions, noise_distributions)

    # Sampling from the observational setting
    samples = anm.sample(100)

    # Sampling under a shift intervention on variable 1
    samples = anm.sample(100, shift_interventions = {1: noise.normal(0,1)})

LGANMs - Linear Gaussian Additive Noise Models
----------------------------------------------

The ``sempler.LGANM`` class defines linear models with Gaussian additive
noise (i.e. a Gaussian Bayesian networks).

LGANMs are defined by providing the following arguments:

-  ``W`` (``np.array``): weighted connectivity matrix representing the
   DAG, where ``W[i,j]=w`` denotes a directed edge from i to j with weight w.
-  ``variances`` (``np.array`` or ``tuple``): the variances of the noise
   terms. Can be either a vector of variances or a tuple indicating a
   range for their uniform sampling.
-  ``means`` (``np.array`` or ``tuple``, optional): the means of the
   noise terms. Either a vector of means or a tuple indicating the range
   for uniform sampling. If left unspecified all means are set to zero.

Sampling
~~~~~~~~

Sampling is again done by calling the ``sample`` function, with
parameters:

-  ``n`` (``int``, optinal): the number of samples. Ignored if
   ``population`` is True, defaults to 100.
-  ``population`` (``bool``, optional): If set to True, parameter ``n``
   is ignored and ``sample`` returns a ``sempler.NormalDistribution``
   object, which is a symbolic gaussian distribution (see below).
-  ``do\_interventions`` (``dict``, optional): Dictionary with keys
   being the targets of the interventions and values being either a
   number (the variable is deterministically set to this value) or a
   tuple with the mean and variance of the normal distribution from
   which to sample the variable.
-  ``shift\_interventions`` (``dict``, optional): Dictionary with keys
   being the targets of the interventions and values being either a
   number (which is then added to the variable) or a tuple with the mean
   and variance of the normal distribution from which to sample added
   noise.

An example: creating a LGANM with noise means and variances sampled
uniformly from [0,1], and sampling from it.

.. code:: python

    import sempler
    import numpy as np

    # Connectivity matrix
    W = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0],
                  [0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 3.2, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5.0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

    # All together
    lganm = sempler.LGANM(W, (0,1), (0,1))

    # Sampling from the observational setting
    samples = lganm.sample(100)

    # Sampling under a shift intervention on variable 1 with standard gaussian noise
    samples = lganm.sample(100, shift_interventions = {1: (0,1)})

    # Sampling the observational environment in the "population setting"
    distribution = lganm.sample(population = True)

Symbolic Normal Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``sempler.NormalDistribution`` class allows for symbolic
representation of a multivariate normal distribution, and is returned
when calling ``LGANM.sample`` with ``population=True``.

An example:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import sempler

    # Define by mean and covariance
    mean = np.array([1,2,3])
    covariance = np.array([[1, 2, 4], [2, 6, 5], [4, 5, 1]])
    distribution = sempler.NormalDistribution(mean, covariance)

    # Marginal distribution of X0 and X1 (also a NormalDistribution object)
    marginal = distribution.marginal([0, 1])

    # Conditional distribution of X2 on X1=1 (also a NormalDistribution object)
    conditional = distribution.conditional(2,1,1)

    # Regress X0 on X1 and X2 in the population setting (no estimation errors)
    (coefs, intercept) = distribution.regress(0, [1,2])
