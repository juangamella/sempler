Welcome to sempler's documentation!
===================================

Sempler allows you to generate observational and interventional data from general structural causal models.

Generating synthetic data
-------------------------

Two classes are defined for this purpose.

- :class:`sempler.ANM` is for general (acyclic) additive noise SCMs. Any assignment function is possible, as are the distributions of the noise terms.
- :class:`sempler.LGANM` is for linear Gaussian SCMs. While this is also possible with :class:`sempler.ANM`, this class simplifies the interface and offers the additional functionality of sampling "in the population setting", i.e. by returning a symbolic gaussian distribution (see :func:`sempler.LGANM.sample` and :class:`sempler.NormalDistribution`).

To allow for random generation of SCMs and interventional distributions, the module :class:`sempler.generators` contains functions to sample random DAGs and intervention targets.

Generating semi-synthetic data
------------------------------
  
The class :class:`sempler.DRFSCM` provides an implementation of the semi-synthetic data generation procedure described in :ref:`[1, appendix F] <references main>`.

**Please cite** :ref:`[1]<references class>` **if you use this procedure for your work.**

Versioning
**********

Sempler is still at its infancy and its API is subject to change. Non backward-compatible changes to the API are reflected by a change to the minor or major version number, e.g.

    *code written using sempler==0.1.2 will run with sempler==0.1.3, but may not run with sempler==0.2.0.*

About the Name
**************

*Structural causal models* are sometimes referred to in the literature as *structural equation models*, or SEMs. The name sempler comes from *SEM sampler*.
