sempler.ANM
===========

The `sempler.ANM` class allows to define and sample from general
additive noise models. Any assignment function is possible, as are the
noise term distributions. The underlying graph is assumed to be
acyclic.

The ANM is represented by (1) the adjacency matrix of the underlying
graph, (2) the assignment functions, and (3) the
distribution of the noise terms.
